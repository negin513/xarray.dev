# Accelerating AI/ML Workflows in Earth Sciences with GPU-Native Xarray and Zarr (and more!)

## TL;DR

## Introduction

In large-scale geospatial AI and machine learning workflows, data loading is often the main bottleneck. Traditional pipelines rely on CPUs to preprocess and transfer massive datasets from storage to GPU memory, consuming resources and limiting scalability and effective use of GPU resources.

To tackle this issue, a team from the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF-NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu) and [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org) with mentors from [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com) participated in the [OpenHackathon](https://www.openhackathons.org/s/) to demonstrate how AI/ML workflows in Earth system sciences can benefit from GPU-native workflows using tools such as [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/), [KvikIO](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/kvikio/stable/), and [DALI](https://developer.nvidia.com/dali).

In this post, we share our hackathon experience, the integration strategies we explored, and the performance gains we achieved to highlight how modern tools can transform data-intensive workflows.

## Problem

Machine learning pipelines typically involve:

- Reading data from disk or object storage.
- Transforming / preprocessing data (often CPU-bound).
- Feeding the data into GPUs for training or inference.

Although GPU compute is incredibly fast, the CPU can become a bottleneck when dealing with large datasets (profiles discussed below).

In this hackathon, we tried looking at different ways of reducing this bottleneck.

### Data & Code Overview ðŸ“Š

For this hackathon, we developed a benchmark of training a U-NET (with ResNet backend) model on the ERA-5 Dataset to predict next time steps. The U-Net model is implemented in PyTorch and the training pipeline is built using PyTorch DataLoader. The model can be trained on a single GPU or multiple GPUs using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for parallelization.

-- TODO : Add an example image.

The basic data loader is implemented in `zarr_ML_optimization/train_unet.py` and the model is defined in `zarr_ML_optimization/model.py`. The training pipeline is designed to be flexible and can be easily adapted to different datasets and models.

More details on the model and training pipeline can be found in the [README](https://github.com/pangeo-data/ncar-hackathon-xarray-on-gpus/blob/main/zarr_ML_optimization/README.md) file in the `zarr_ML_optimization` folder.

### Performance Bottlenecks

First, we needed to identify the performance bottlenecks in our pipeline. We used NVIDIA's [Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) to profile our code and identify the areas that needed optimization. The profiling results clearly showed that the data loading step was the main bottleneck in our pipeline. Additionally, we noticed the alternating CPU and GPU compute steps (i.e. data loading and model training) were not overlapping, which meant that the GPU was often idle while waiting for the CPU to load data (fist screenshot above).

Here are some screenshots of the profiling results:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

  <img
    src='/posts/gpu-pipline/profiling_screenshot2.png'
    alt='Issue 2'
    style={{ width: '55%' }}
  />
</div>

This was further confirmed by additional tests comparing data loading and training throughput, as illustrated in the figure below:

<img
  src='/posts/gpu-pipline/baseline.png'
  alt='baseline plot'
  style={{ display: 'inline-block', width: '50%', maxWidth: '400px' }}
/>

In the plot above, we show the throughput of the data loading and training steps in our pipeline. The three bars represent:

- Real Data: Baseline throughput of the end-to-end pipeline using real data.
- No Training (i.e. data loading throughput): Throughput of the data loading without any training (to measure the time spent on data loading vs. training).
- Synthetic Data (i.e. Training throughput): Throughput of the data loading using synthetic data (to remove the data loading bottleneck).

The results show that the data loading step is the main bottleneck in our pipeline, with **much** lower throughput compared to the training step.

## Hackathon: Strategies Explored!

Our initial profiling showed that data loading is a major bottleneck in this workflow.

During the hackathon, we tested the following strategies to improve the data loading performance:

1. **Optimized Chunking & Compression**
   - We explored different chunking and compression strategies to optimize the data loading performance. We found that using Zarr v3 with optimized chunking and compression significantly improved the data loading performance.
2. **GPU native data loading with Zarr V3 and KvikIO**
   - Leveraging Zarr v3's support for reading data directly into GPU memory using CuPy arrays, we utilized KvikIO to bypass CPU memory, enabling direct data transfer from storage to GPU.
3. **Using `nvcomp` for decompression on GPUs**
   - We explored using NVIDIA's nvCOMP library for GPU-accelerated decompression of Zarr data. This allowed us to offload the decompression step to the GPU, reducing the time spent on data loading.
4. **NVIDIA DALI**: We explored integrating NVIDIA's Data Loading Library (DALI) into our pipeline to facilitate efficient data loading and preprocessing directly on the GPU. NVIDIA DALI provides highly optimized building blocks and an execution engine for data processing, accelerating deep learning applications.

### Step 1: Optimized chunking

The ERA-5 dataset we were using had a sub-optimal chunking scheme of `{'time': 10, 'channel': C, 'height': H, 'width': W}`, which meant that a minimum of 10 timesteps of data was being read even if we only needed 2 consecutive timesteps at a time.
We decided to rechunk the data to align with our access pattern of 1-timestep at a time, while reformating to Zarr v3.
The full script is available [here](https://github.com/pangeo-data/ncar-hackathon-xarray-on-gpus/blob/main/rechunk/era5_rechunking.ipynb), with the main code looking like so:

```python
import xarray as xr

ds: xr.Dataset = xr.open_mfdataset("ERA5.zarr")
# Rechunk the data
ds = ds.chunk({"time": 1, "level": 1, "latitude": 640, "longitude": 1280})
# Save to Zarr v3
ds.to_zarr("rechunked_ERA5.zarr", zarr_version=3)
```

For more optimal performance, consider:

1. Storing the data without compression (if not transferring over a network), as decompressing data can slow down read speeds. But see also GPU decompression with nvCOMP below. ðŸ˜‰
2. Concatenating several data variables together **if** a single chunk size is too small (`<1MB`), at the expense of reducing readability of the Zarr store.
   Having too many small chunks can be detrimental to read speeds. A compressed chunk should be `>1MB`, `<100MB` for optimal reads.
   - Alternatively, wait for [sharding](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/performance.html#sharding) to be supported for GPU buffers in zarr-python.
3. Align chunks with access pattern of your model.

The plot below shows the read performance of the original dataset vs. the rechunked dataset (to optimal chunk size) vs. uncompressed zarr v3 dataset.

TODO: ADD plot here.

### Step 2: Reading with zarr-python v3 + kvikIO ðŸ“–

The advent of [Zarr v3](https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-3-release/) bought many improvements, including the ability to [read from Zarr stores to CuPy arrays (i.e. GPU memory)](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/2574).

Specifically, you can use the [`zarr-python`](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) driver to read data from zarr->CPU->GPU, or the [`kvikio`](https://github.com/rapidsai/kvikio) driver to read data from zarr->GPU directly!

To benefit from these new features, we recommend installing:

- [`zarr>=3.0.3`](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/releases/tag/v3.0.3)
- [`xarray>=2025.03.00`](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/releases/tag/v2025.03.0)
- [`kvikio>=25.04.00`](https://github.com/rapidsai/kvikio/releases/tag/v25.04.00)

Reading to GPU can be enabled by using the [`zarr.config.enable_gpu()`](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.6/user-guide/gpu.html) setting like so:

```python
import cupy as cp
import xarray as xr
import zarr

airt = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature", engine="netcdf4")
airt.to_zarr(store="/tmp/air-temp.zarr", mode="w", zarr_format=3, consolidated=False)

with zarr.config.enable_gpu():
    ds = xr.open_dataset("/tmp/air-temp.zarr", engine="zarr", consolidated=False)
    assert isinstance(ds.air.data, cp.ndarray)
```

Note that using `engine="zarr"` like above would still result in data being loaded into CPU memory before it goes to GPU memory.

If you prefer to bypass CPU memory, and have GPU Direct Storage (GDS) enabled, you can use the `kvikio` driver like so:

```python
import kvikio.zarr

with zarr.config.enable_gpu():
    store = kvikio.zarr.GDSStore(root="/tmp/air-temp.zarr")
    ds = xr.open_dataset(filename_or_obj=store, engine="zarr")
    assert isinstance(ds.air.data, cp.ndarray)
```

This will read the data directly from the Zarr store to GPU memory, bypassing CPU memory. This is especially useful for large datasets, as it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred between CPU and GPU memory, but requires GPU Direct Storage (GDS) to be enabled on your system. For now decompression is still done on CPU, but this is a step towards a fully GPU-native workflow. In the figure below, we show the flowchart of the data loading process with GDS enabled , but please note that the decompression step is still done on CPU.

![Flowchart-technically decompression is still done on CPUs](/posts/gpu-pipline/flowchart_2.png)

Eventually with this [cupy-xarray Pull Request merged](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/cupy-xarray/pull/70) (based on earlier work at https://xarray.dev/blog/xarray-kvikio), this can be simplified to:

```python
import cupy_xarray

ds = xr.open_dataset(filename_or_obj="/tmp/air-temp.zarr", engine="kvikio")
assert isinstance(ds.air.data, cp.ndarray)
```

How do these two methods, Zarr (CPU) and kvikio (GPU), compare?

(TODO put in benchmark numbers here).

**Note**: For kvikio performance improvements, you need GPU Direct Storage (GDS) enabled on your system. This is a feature that allows the GPU to access data directly from storage, bypassing the CPU and reducing latency. GDS is supported on NVIDIA GPUs with the [GPUDirect Storage](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/pgp/gds/index.html) feature.

### Step 3: GPU-based decompression with nvCOMP ðŸš€

For a fully GPU-native workflow, we can let the GPU do all of the work, including decompression. This is where [NVIDIA's nvCOMP](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvcomp) library comes in. nvCOMP provides GPU-accelerated compression and decompression algorithms for various data formats, including Zstandard (Zstd). This means that all steps of data loading including reading, decompressing, and transforming data can be done on the GPU, significantly reducing the time spent on data loading (see figure below).

![GPU native decompression](/posts/gpu-pipline/flowchart_3.png)

Sending compressed instead of uncompressed data to the GPU means less data transfer overall, reducing I/O latency from storage to device.
To unlock this, we would need zarr-python to support GPU-based decompression codecs, with one for Zstandard (Zstd) currently being implemented in [this PR](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/2863).

![GPU native decompression](/posts/gpu-pipline/zstd_benchmark.png)

Figure above shows benchmark comparing CPU vs GPU-based decompression, with or without GDS enabled using [the data reading benchmark here](https://github.com/pangeo-data/ncar-hackathon-xarray-on-gpus/blob/main/benchmark/era5_zarr_benchmark.py).

These results show that GPU-based decompression can significantly reduce the time spent on data loading and cut I/O latency from storage to device. This is especially useful for large datasets, as it allows for faster data loading and processing.

Keep an eye on this space, as we are working on integrating this into the Zarr ecosystem to enable GPU-based decompression for Zarr stores. This will allow for a fully GPU-native workflow, where all steps of data loading, including reading, decompressing, and transforming data, can be done on the GPU. ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: Even without full GDS support, GPU-based decompression can dramatically reduce latency and free up CPU resources for other tasks.

### Step 4: Overlapping CPU and GPU compute with NVIDIA DALI ðŸ”€

Ideally, we want to minimize idle time on both the CPU and GPU by overlapping their workloads. In traditional PyTorch DataLoaders, data loading and preprocessing often happen sequentially before GPU training can beginâ€”this creates stalls where the GPU sits idle waiting for input (as seen in our baseline profiling screenshots above).

To address this inefficiency, we adopted [NVIDIA DALI (Data Loading Library)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/index.html), which provides a flexible, GPU-accelerated data pipeline with built-in support for asynchronous execution across CPU and GPU stages. DALI helps reduce CPU pressure, enables concurrent preprocessing, and increases training throughput by pipelining operations.

To start, we started with a minimal example in [zarr_DALI folder](https://github.com/pangeo-data/ncar-hackathon-xarray-on-gpus/tree/main/zarr_DALI) with short, contained examples of a DALI pipeline loading directly from Zarr stores. This example shows how to create a custom DALI `pipeline` that uses an `ExternalSource` operator to load batched image data from a Zarr store, transfer them directly to GPU memory using CuPy-backed arrays.

Next, look at the [zarr_ML_optimization](https://github.com/pangeo-data/ncar-hackathon-xarray-on-gpus/tree/main/zarr_ML_optimization) folder that contains an end-to-end example on how this DALI pipeline can be integrated into a Pytorch Dataloader and full training workflow.

(TODO insert better nsight profiling figure than above showing overlapping CPU and GPU compute)

## Going Forward ðŸ”®

This work is still ongoing, and we are continuing to explore ways to optimize data loading and processing for large-scale geospatial AI/ML workflows. We started this work during a 3-day hackathon, and we are excited to continue this work in the future. During the hackathon, we were able to make significant progress in optimizing data loading and processing for large-scale geospatial AI/ML workflows.

We are continuing to explore the following areas:

- GPU Direct Storage (GDS) for optimal performance
- NVIDIA DALI
- Support for sharded Zarr with GPU-friendly access patterns.
- Work out how to use GDS when reading from cloud object store instead of on-prem disk.
- GPU-based decompression with nvCOMP

## Lessons Learned ðŸ’¡

- **Chunking matters!** It really does and can make a huge difference in performance.
- **GPU Direct Storage (GDS)** can be an improvement for data-intensive workflows, but requires some setup and configuration.
- Compression trade-offs: Using compression can reduce the amount of data transferred, but can also increase the time spent on decompression. We found that using Zarr v3 with GPU-based decompression can significantly improve performance.
- **NVIDIA DALI** is a powerful tool for optimizing data loading, but requires some effort to integrate into existing workflows.
- **GPU-native decompression** is a promising area for future work, but requires further development and testing.
